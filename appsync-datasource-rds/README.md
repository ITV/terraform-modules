# Deepmerge

This module provides functionality identical to the `aws_appsync_datasource` resource, but is specifically for the `RELATIONAL_DATABASE` resource type (which is not currently supported by `aws_appsync_datasource`). Once [this pull request](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/pull/9337) is merged and released, this module will no longer serve a purpose.
